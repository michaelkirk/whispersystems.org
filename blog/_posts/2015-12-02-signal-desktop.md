Today we're making the Signal Desktop beta available. Signal Desktop brings the
trusted private messaging experience of Signal to the desktop, with a simplicity
that allows you to seamlessly continue conversations back and forth between
your mobile device and your desktop computer.

### Private messaging, now with all ten fingers

As always, everything is end-to-end encrypted and painstakingly engineered in order to keep your communication
safe -- allowing you to send high-quality private group, text, picture, and video messages for free.

### Multiple devices, single identifier

Signal Desktop is a Chrome app which links with your phone, so all incoming and outgoing messages
are displayed consistently on all your devices.  Your contacts don't have to guess
where to message you, and when you switch devices the conversation you started
will already be there.
